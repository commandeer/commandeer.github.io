# LocalStack

LocalStack is one of our favorite tools for simulating the AWS environment. It is a mock environment that mimics many of the most popular AWS services. You are able to stand up many different services, such as S3 or Dynamo, and have complete access to the files or NoSQL data exactly is it would appear on AWS.

Why does this matter? Because running things locally is great for many reasons. It is much faster and it saves CPU costs on AWS for starters. We feel it also allows you to get a better feel for how your system is actually operating. You can also test outages of certain services much easier than trying to do it directly on AWS.
